Open Hardware Miniconf 2016 - ESPlant - Environment Sensor Plant
=============

Welcome to the linux.conf.au Open Hardware Project.  You can see information about this and other MiniConfs at http://www.openhardwareconf.org/wiki/Main_Page

The ESPlant kit is designed to provide an open source platform to transmit environmental data to a central source using the power of wifi.

This year we've got a pretty tricky restriction.  Unfortunately we don't have a workshop where we can solder so it's screw terminals and hot glue all the way down.
